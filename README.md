# DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor Library

This library provides an interface for the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor. It includes functionality to read and process temperature and humidity data from the sensor. The library is designed to be used with microcontroller platforms such as Arduino.

## Features

- Read humidity and temperature data
- Error handling for timeout and checksum errors

## Requirements

This library is designed to work with the Arduino platform. You will need the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the code to your microcontroller.

## Installation

1. Download the library files.
2. Place the `dht11.h` and associated source files into your Arduino/libraries folder.
3. Restart the Arduino IDE to recognize the new library.

## Usage

To use this library, you must include it at the beginning of your Arduino sketch:

```cpp
#include "dht11.h"
